**Abstract**: Biodiversity information is inherently complex and is highly distributed in collaborations from all over the world. The application of inventory of Biodiversity Information is a content management system and an end-user may have a technical threshold in maintaining this kind of application. We apply the idea of a software framework at the web application level and implement it as practical web application: Cypriniformes Commons (CypsCom), one inventory solution to store related biodiversity information for the fish Order Cypriniformes. In CypsCom, a biologist can provide multiple layers of information on a taxon through this web-based application and other biologists can review these contributions in an orderly scientific process built in CypsCom. Deploying this kind of software framework at the web application level makes it possible to implement this framework in different programming languages and be applied by different biodiversity research communities.
