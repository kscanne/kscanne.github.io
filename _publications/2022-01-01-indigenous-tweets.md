excerpt: 'This chapter is a case study in collecting and managing linguistic data from Twitter as part of the Indigenous Tweets project, which was founded in 2011 as a way of promoting the use of Indigenous and minority languages in social media. Our principal aim in this chapter is to describe our data management procedures in sufficient detail that linguists, sociolinguists, lexicographers, or community language activists with some programming skills can begin experimenting with Twitter data themselves.'
