**Abstract**: Grafting is a method of obtaining new projective structures from a hyperbolic structure, basically by gluing a flat cylinder into a surface along a closed geodesic in the hyperbolic structure, or by limits of that procedure. This induces a map of Teichmüller space to itself. We prove that this map is a homeomorphism by analyzing harmonic maps between pairs of grafted surfaces. As a corollary we obtain bending coordinates for the Bers embedding of Teichmüller space.
