**DOI**: [doi:10.1088/0264-9381/18/9/306](http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/18/9/306)

**Abstract**: We continue work initiated in a 1990 preprint of Mess giving a geometric parametrization of the moduli space of classical solutions to Einstein's equations in (2+1) dimensions with cosmological constant Λ = 0 or -1 (the case of Λ = +1 has been worked out in the interim by the present author). In this paper we make a first step toward the (3+1)-dimensional case by determining exactly which closed 3-manifolds M<sup>3</sup> arise as spacelike slices of flat spacetimes, and by finding all possible holonomy homomorphisms π<sub>1</sub>(M<sup>3</sup>)→ISO(3,1).
