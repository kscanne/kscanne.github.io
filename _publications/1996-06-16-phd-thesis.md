Our main theorem is a classification of compact de Sitter manifolds,
complementing results of G. Mess in the flat and anti-de Sitter cases.
The first part of the classification asserts that every de Sitter spacetime
which is a small regular neighborhood of a compact spacelike hypersurface
isometrically embeds in a standard de Sitter spacetime.
This fact is used to obtain our second main result, which states
that a compact (2+1)-dimensional de Sitter spacetime with non-empty spacelike
boundary is homeomorphic to a product.
