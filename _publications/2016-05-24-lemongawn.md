**Abstract**: We introduce lemonGAWN, a conversion of WordNet Gaeilge, a wordnet for the Irish language, with synset relations projected from EuroWordNet. lemonGAWN is linked to the English WordNet, as well as the wordnets for four Iberian languages covered by Multilingual Central Repository (MCR), and additionally contains links to both the Irish and English editions of DBpedia.
