**Abstract**: Let Γ be a torsion-free lattice in SO<sub>0</sub>(3,1), and let M = Γ\H<sup>3</sup> be the corresponding hyperbolic 3-manifold. It is well-known that in the presence of a closed, embedded, totally-geodesic surface in M, the canonical flat conformal structure on M can be deformed via the bending construction. Equivalently, the lattice Γ admits non-trivial deformations into SO<sub>0</sub>(4,1). We present a new construction of infinitesimal deformations for the hyperbolic Fibonacci manifolds, the smallest of which is non-Haken and contains no immersed totally geodesic surface.
