**Abstract**: The stamping deformation was defined by Apanasov as the first example of a deformation of the flat conformal structure on a hyperbolic 3-orbifold distinct from bending. We show that in fact the stamping cocycle is equal to the sum of three bending cocycles. We also obtain a more general result, showing that geodesic lengths are constant to first order under deformations of the flat conformal structure for any hyperbolic 3-orbifold.
