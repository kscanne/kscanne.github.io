**Abstract**: Given a compact n-manifold Σ with a flat conformal structure,
there is a canonical procedure for constructing an associated (n+1)-dimensional
de Sitter spacetime homeomorphic to Σ×(0,∞); we call these
*standard de Sitter spacetimes*. Our main theorem is a classification of
compact de Sitter manifolds; it asserts that every de Sitter
spacetime which is a small regular neighborhood of a closed spacelike
hypersurface isometrically embeds in a standard de Sitter spacetime.
This complements results of G. Mess in the flat and anti-de Sitter cases.
