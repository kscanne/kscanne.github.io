**Abstract**: We give the first explicit computations of rational homotopy groups of spaces of “long knots” in Euclidean spaces. We define a spectral sequence which converges to these rational homotopy groups whose E<sup>1</sup> term is defined in terms of familiar Lie algebras. For odd k we establish a vanishing line for this spectral sequence, show the Euler characteristic of the rows of this E<sup>1</sup> term is zero, and make calculations of E<sup>2</sup> in a finite range.
