**Abstract**: In this paper, we measure the effectiveness of using language standardisation, lemmatisation, and machine translation to improve full-text search results on *dúchas.ie*, the web interface to the Irish National Folklore Collection. Our focus is the Schools’ Collection, a scanned manuscript collection which is being transcribed by members of the public via a crowdsourcing initiative. We show that by applying these technologies to the manuscript page transcriptions, we obtain substantial improvements in search engine recall over a test set of actual user queries, with no appreciable drop in precision. Our results motivate the inclusion of this language technology in the search infrastructure of this folklore resource.
