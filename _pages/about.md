I am a software developer specializing in computational resources that help
speakers of indigenous and minority languages use their language online.
As an Irish speaker, I am particularly interested in supporting 
the Irish, Manx, and Scottish Gaelic communities in my work.
I have expertise in machine learning, natural language processing,
machine translation, syntactic parsing, and language modeling.
My academic training was in pure mathematics, and I worked primarily 
on the geometry and topology of hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

Between 1998 and 2023, I was a professor
of mathematics and computer science at Saint Louis University in
St. Louis, Missouri, USA.
This site is intended as an archive of my academic work, going back to
[my 1996 Ph.D. thesis](/publication/1996-06-16-phd-thesis),
written under the supervision of Prof. Geoffrey Mess.
You can find all of my [publications](/publications/),
[academic talks](/talks/), and 
[courses taught](/teaching/) through the links at the top of the page.

If you are an Irish speaker, you will find a few papers and lectures
in Irish here, but you are more likely to find what you need on
my company's website, [Cadhan Aonair](https://cadhan.com/).
