**Abstract**: I'll discuss some of the challenges faced by minority language communities when developing advanced languages technologies such as machine translation and speech recognition, and some strategies we've employed for meeting those challenges. Most of the talk will focus on Irish and the other Celtic languages but I will also discuss efforts to scale up to the “next” 1000+ languages to come online.
