Seminar talk.

Abstract: Text corpora have played a key role in the creation of monolingual and bilingual dictionaries for several decades at least. Recent advances in NLP have given lexicographers powerful new tools for exploring corpora, distinguishing word senses, and crafting dictionary entries. I'll discuss some of the tools and corpus resources that are being used to create the first historical dictionary of the Irish language at the Royal Irish Academy.
