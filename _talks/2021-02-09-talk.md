**Abstract**: The Celtic languages share a common linguistic phenomenon known as “initial mutations”; these consist of pronunciation and spelling changes that occur at the beginning of some words, triggered in certain semantic or syntactic contexts. Initial mutations occur quite frequently and all non-trivial NLP systems for the Celtic languages must learn to handle them properly. I will describe recent work on neural network models for predicting mutations in two of the six Celtic languages, Irish and Scottish Gaelic, and work in progress on Manx Gaelic. I will also discuss applications of these models to grammatical error detection and language modeling.
